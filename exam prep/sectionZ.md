# PCAP Exam Prep: Section Z: Good to Know

## Brackets

### Indexing:
- Used to access a single element in a sequence, such as a list, string, or tuple.
- Specify a single index inside square brackets to indicate the position of the desired element.
```python
lista = [10, 20, 30]
print(lista[1])  # Output: 20

```
### Slicing:
- Used to extract a specific part of a sequence using a range of indices.
- Specify three optional parameters inside square brackets: start, stop, and step, separated by colons (:).
- start indicates the starting index (inclusive), stop indicates the stopping index (exclusive), and step indicates the size of the step or increment.
- Slicing allows you to select a subsequence of elements from the original sequence.
```python

```
### Negative Indexing:
- Used to access elements from the end of the sequence backwards.
- Specify a negative index inside square brackets to indicate the position of the element counting from the end of the sequence.
```python

```
### Nested List Indexing:
- Used to access elements in a list that contains nested lists or other sequences.
- Specify an additional index inside square brackets to indicate the position of the element in the nested list.
```python

```
### Slicing with Step:
- Used to select elements with a certain step within a sequence.
- Specify a third parameter inside square brackets to indicate the step size or increment.
- This allows you to select elements at regular intervals within the sequence.
```python

```
### Assignment of Values:
- Used to modify or assign a value to a specific element in a sequence.
- Specify an index inside square brackets to indicate the position of the element to be modified, followed by an assignment operator (=).
```python

```
### Deletion of Elements:
- Used to delete an element or a range of elements from a sequence.
- Specify an index or a range of indices inside square brackets, followed by the del keyword.
```python

```
### Creating Lists:
- Used to define a list of elements.
- Specify the elements separated by commas inside square brackets to create a new list.
```python

```
