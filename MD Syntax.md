These are the basics of Markdown syntax. It's a versatile language with support for many more features like task lists, strikethrough text, and more. Different platforms may support slightly different Markdown extensions, so it's always a good idea to check the specific documentation.Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.
