# Escaping Markdown Characters
Use a backslash (\) to escape Markdown characters if you want to display them as literals.

# Comments
Markdown doesn't have native support for comments, but some platforms like GitHub support HTML comments:

<!-- This is a comment -->

# line break / new line

1. Using Double Space:
Ending a line with two or more spaces followed by a line break creates a new line.

2. Using <br> Tag (HTML):
You can also use HTML <br> tags to force a line break.

These are the basics of Markdown syntax. It's a versatile language with support for many more features like task lists, strikethrough text, and more. Different platforms may support slightly different Markdown extensions, so it's always a good idea to check the specific documentation.Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.
